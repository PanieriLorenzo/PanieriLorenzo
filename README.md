# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm Lorenzo Panieri. I recently graduated Computer Engineering BSc at [Aarhus University](https://au.dk) in Denmark. I'm currently employed at BEUMER Group A/S.

I also work a lot with signal processing in Rust and I am active in the [Rust-Audio community](https://github.com/RustAudio). 
I use my signal processing and Rust skills to develop free [audio plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_plug-in)
for music production sofware. I make the code available for all my plugins under the ["St√∏jmaskiner"](https://github.com/Stoejmaskiner) organization (formerly ["Flux-Audio"](https://github.com/Flux-Audio).

If you want, you can suggest ideas for plugins over at [this repository](https://github.com/Stoejmaskiner/planned-projects).
