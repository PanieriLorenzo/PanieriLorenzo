# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm Lorenzo Panieri. Currently I am studying computer engineering at [Aarhus University](https://au.dk) in Denmark. 
I also work a lot with signal processing in Rust and I am active in the [Rust-Audio community](https://github.com/RustAudio). 
I use my signal processing and Rust skills to develop free [VST plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) 
for music production sofware. I make the code available for all my plugins under the ["Flux-Audio"](https://github.com/Flux-Audio) 
alias. If you want, you can suggest ideas for plugins over at [this repository](https://github.com/Flux-Audio/planned_projects).
