# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm Lorenzo Panieri. I'm taking a Masters degree in Computer Engineering at [Aarhus University](https://au.dk) in Denmark.

I also work a lot with signal processing in Rust and I am active in the [Rust-Audio community](https://github.com/RustAudio). 
I use my signal processing and Rust skills to develop free [audio plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_plug-in)
for music production sofware. I make the code available for all my plugins under the ["Stoejmaskiner"](https://gitlab.com/stoejmaskiner) organization (formerly ["Flux-Audio"](https://github.com/Flux-Audio)).

## What to expect

My personal page is full of random experiments. You are free to take a look around, but any serious work happens over at my organization [St√∏jmaskiner](https://github.com/Stoejmaskiner). I mainly use the Rust and Python programming languages, as I'm deeply in love with both of them. At the moment I do a lot of programming language design experiments.

Some cool projects I'm actively working on:
- [rslox](../../../rslox): Yet another implementation of the Lox language in Rust
- [ez_cache](../../../ez_cache): A simple mem/disk caching and memoization library for Python
